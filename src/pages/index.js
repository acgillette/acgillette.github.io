                    <p>Hey there! I'm an artist, writer and developer currently based in the Bay Area. My day job is building interfaces for scientific software. When I'm not doing that, I can be found making art, writing, or baking bread, among other things.</p><br></br>
                    <p>This is my personal spot for my art, writing, and whatever else I feel like dropping in here. I'm interested in tending to this site as one might tend to a garden, in that I primarily am looking to plant some thoughts and see how it grows.</p><br></br>

                    <p>If you're interested in seeing some things I've made, I have an ongoing feed of things I make at <Link to="/imadethis">imadethis</Link>.</p><br></br>
                    <p>I keep my notes about various things I'm interested in a <Link to="/notes">notes</Link> section.</p><br></br>
