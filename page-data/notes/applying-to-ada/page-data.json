I had taken a smattering of intro classes in college in Java/C as well as studio art classes in creative coding. I then taught myself some HTML/CSS + Ruby to prepare myself for applying to schools.

Don't try and portray yourself as what you feel Ada wants you to be, and don't respond how you think they want you to respond.

If you're already an Excel wizard than you probably won't have issues with this challenge but my excel experience was already several years passed when I did this. I will say that filters and pivot tables were a great help in the challenge. Also, document every step you do and why you did it.

Not necessarily useful for applying, but again very fun and helped me learn how to think like a programmer, especially when solving the algorithmic problems.
